# LUT-based system implementation

- Summary: Deploys clustered weights through lookup-table kernels so non-uniform centroids can be used for lower memory and faster inference.
- Inputs: cluster assignments, centroids, quantized activations, target GPU or CPU kernel path
- Outputs: LUT-backed low-bit inference path, latency and memory measurements
- Assumptions: target hardware can exploit lookup-table execution efficiently, reported speedups depend on kernel/simulator/CPU setup
