# Block-wise error minimization with learnable quantization parameters

- Source paper: [[papers/Shao-et-al-2024-OmniQuant-Omnidirectionally-Calibrated-Quantization-for-Large-Language-Models|Shao et al. - 2024 - OmniQuant Omnidirectionally Calibrated Quantization for Large Language Models]]
- Summary: Freezes full-precision weights but learns a small set of clipping and equivalent-transform parameters by minimizing block output error across weight-only and weight-activation settings.
- Inputs: full-precision transformer block, calibration samples, learnable clipping/scaling/shifting parameters
- Outputs: calibrated quantization parameters, quantized block with reduced reconstruction error
- Assumptions: block-wise reconstruction is a useful proxy for final LLM quality, a restrained parameter set can approach QAT quality without full fine-tuning cost
- Provenance: p. 1; p. 2; p. 3; p. 4
