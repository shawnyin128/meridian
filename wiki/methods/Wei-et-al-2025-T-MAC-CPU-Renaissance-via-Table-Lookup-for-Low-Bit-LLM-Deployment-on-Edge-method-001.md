# LUT-based system implementation

- Source paper: [[papers/Wei-et-al-2025-T-MAC-CPU-Renaissance-via-Table-Lookup-for-Low-Bit-LLM-Deployment-on-Edge|Wei et al. - 2025 - T-MAC CPU Renaissance via Table Lookup for Low-Bit LLM Deployment on Edge]]
- Summary: Deploys clustered weights through lookup-table kernels so non-uniform centroids can be used for lower memory and faster inference.
- Inputs: cluster assignments, centroids, quantized activations, target GPU or CPU kernel path
- Outputs: LUT-backed low-bit inference path, latency and memory measurements
- Assumptions: target hardware can exploit lookup-table execution efficiently, reported speedups depend on kernel/simulator/CPU setup
- Provenance: p. 1; p. 2; p. 4; p. 5
