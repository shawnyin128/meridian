# LUT-based system implementation

- Source paper: [[papers/Guo-2025-Fast-Matrix-Multiplications-for-Lookup-Table-Quantized-LLMs|Guo 等 - 2025 - Fast Matrix Multiplications for Lookup Table-Quantized LLMs]]
- Summary: Deploys clustered weights through lookup-table kernels so non-uniform centroids can be used for lower memory and faster inference.
- Inputs: cluster assignments, centroids, quantized activations, target GPU or CPU kernel path
- Outputs: LUT-backed low-bit inference path, latency and memory measurements
- Assumptions: target hardware can exploit lookup-table execution efficiently, reported speedups depend on kernel/simulator/CPU setup
- Provenance: p. 1; p. 2; p. 3; p. 4
